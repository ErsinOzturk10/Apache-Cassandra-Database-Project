# Apache-Cassandra-Database-Project

Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. 
I created a database for understanding what songs users are listening to. 
I processed the event_datafile_new.csv dataset to created a denormalized dataset. 
I modeled the data tables keeping in mind the queries I need to run. 
And then I produced the queries and run them in order to answer the analysis questions.
